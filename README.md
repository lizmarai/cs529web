STEP 1. To initialize a github website with your website code:

First, make sure the machine you are working on has the correct github sshkey:
ssh-keygen
cd .ssh
ls
less id_rsa.pub
then paste into this file the github sshkey for your github account

Then using the github website make a new repository/project under github and land on the Quick setup with SSH instructions.

On the local machine make a new directory foobar/ and cd to it.

git clone git@github.com:lizmarai/cs426web.git (or whatever the pathway listed under Quick setup says under ssh).

cp -R all files to foobar ( cp -R ../Downloads/cs426_webpage-main/\* cs426/)

cd cs426

cp -R \_site docs

git add -f \*

git commit -m "first"

git push

STEP 2: Make the website visible
Go to Settings for that new project, Pages, then Deploy from Branch, then main/ /docs

STEP 3: Modify the website
git config pull.rebase false

git pull

<modify the files as necessary>; check the website builds correctly in your terminal:
npm start &
(the version displayed will be based on the \_site files that you build through this command)

copy the \_site files to the docs/ folder then git add -f \*, git commit, and git push

This is the source code for Prof. Jakob Eriksson's personal webpage, viewable at http://www.cs.uic.edu/~jakob.
Feel free to fork this repo to make your own UIC-themed webpage.

To use it, first install node. On a mac, that would be
`brew install node`. On linux, `apt-get install nodejs npm`.

Then install the static site generator 11ty and the CSS framework tailwind.
`npm install -D @11ty/eleventy tailwindcss@latest`

To use this as a template, start by updatin the settings in `_data/defaults.json' to reflect your name, title and a suitable portrait. Delete the contents of 'photos/' and add some of your own. Use landscape oriented photos of high resolution, and with your face fairly prominent and centered. Then, simply edit `home.md`, `projects.md`and`news.md` with your own content, and you're good to go.

To try it out, run `npm start` in the main folder, and open your website in a browser using the URL `localhost:8080`.
The `Makefile` contains a handy target for uploading your site to your Computer Science department `WWW` folder. Works for me, but your YMMV as that's a pretty outdated system.

# CS529 Website – Updated Instructions (For future reference)

This website is built with Eleventy (11ty) and Tailwind CSS and is deployed using GitHub Pages.
The live site is served from the `docs/` folder.

## Requirements

Node.js 18 (LTS) is required. Using nvm is recommended.

```
nvm install v20.17.0
nvm use v20.17.0
```

## One-time setup (first time on a machine)

```
git clone https://github.com/lizmarai/cs529web.git
cd cs529web
npm install
```

## How to update the website

### 1. Pull the latest changes

```
git pull
```

### 2. Edit content

Edit Markdown files such as `gallery.md`, `home.md`, or `projects.md`.

Add images to the `_site/photos/` folder.

When referencing images, use absolute paths like:

```
<img src="../photos/fall-2025/example.png" />
```

### 3. Preview locally (recommended)

`npm start`

Open a browser and go to:

`http://localhost:8081`

Stop the server with Ctrl+C when finished.

### 4. Build the site

`npm run build`

This generates the website into the `_site/` folder.

### 5. Publish to GitHub Pages

Copy the generated files and folder from `_site/` into the `docs/` folder:

`cp -R \_site/\* docs/`

### 6. Commit and push changes

```
git add -A
git commit -m "Update website"
git push
```

## View the live site

After about 30–60 seconds, the website will be available at:

`https://lizmarai.github.io/cs529web/`

## Quick checklist

```
git pull
(edit markdown files and photos)
npm run build
cp -R \_site/\* docs/
git add -A
git commit -m "Update"
git push
```

Do NOT edit the `_site/` folder directly except for adding images or videos. It is always regenerated.
